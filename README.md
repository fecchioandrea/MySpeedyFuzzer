# MySpeedyFuzzer
[A really speedy Fuzzing program, working with multithreading]<br><br>
It is a Python-based fuzzer, developed to discover vulnerabilities during web application security assessments. The fuzzer was inspired by the Burp "Intruder" tool, but leverages multi-threading to obtain faster performance with respect to the community edition of Burp. The project has a small codebase and it's fully open-source, to allow other developers to easily write extensions or modify it.<br><br>
