# MySpeedyFuzzer
[A speedy Fuzzing program, working with multithreading]<br><br>
It is a Python-based fuzzer, developed to discover vulnerabilities during web application security assessments. The fuzzer was inspired by the Burp Suite "Intruder" tool, but leverages multi-threading to obtain faster performances, with respect to the Community Edition of Burp Suite. The project has a small codebase and is fully open-source, to allow other developers to easily modify/extend it.<br><br>
